<h4> Don't Struggle with time. </h4>

For many of us, time is our arch enemy. We are always in a race against the clock to finish our jobs, to meet the deadlines. But, **Pomodoro** **Technique** teaches us to utilize the time rather than struggling with time.

<h4> What is Pomodoro Technique? </h4>

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it.

<h4> Technique Behind This </h4>
At its core, the technique behind is quite simple. So simple that most people often dismiss this idea.


The basic idea is that you plan out the work you’re going to do for a day.
Then you set a timer for 25 minutes and work on the first task you’ve
planned. You only work on a single task during one time and give complete attention on this single task.

If you’re interrupted, there are various
ways of handling the interruption, but generally you strive to not be inter-
rupted at all. You never want to break focus. At the end of the 25 minutes, you set a timer for 5 minutes and take a
break. That’s considered 1 pomodoro.

After every 4 **pomodori**, you can take a longer break usually 10-15 minutes.

If you finished your task early than the allocated time, then you are supposed to **overlearning**. That is, you continue to work on the
task by making small improvements or rereading material if you’re try-
ing to learn something. I tend to ignore this part and move on to the
next task immediately.
And this is all about Pomodoro Technique, quite simple yeah?
Francesco originally used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to time the
pomodori (pomodoro is Italian for tomato), but there now exist plenty
of apps for tracking and recording pomodori.

Why don't you give a try?
